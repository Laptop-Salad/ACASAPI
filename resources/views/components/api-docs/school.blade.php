<section id="schools" class="space-y-4 my-4">
    <h3 class="font-semibold text-xl">Schools</h3>

    <p>
        This is not really an endpoint but is a base of all your requests, so I felt it was necessary
        to talk about it in this section. When you create a school you can click to go to see the overview
        of the school. In the URL it should be <x-api-docs.technical>schools/{school id}</x-api-docs.technical>.
        Copy this school id so that you can use it in a request.
    </p>

    <p>
        All requests have to be prefixed with <x-api-docs.technical>schools/{school id}</x-api-docs.technical>
        . The response you get will only be the data attached to that school.
